/* Backend claim arbitration (the claim-core projection boundary).

 * masks, never protocol constructs -- and carries exactly two claim
 * shapes, one per capability bit, because they are arbitrated on entirely
 * different paths and a backend may serve one without the other:
 *
 *   AGGREGATE: one revocable per-node token per file covering the union of
 *     the node's local holders -- rev_used (R|W: data the node reads/writes
 *     or caches) plus bind_deny (R|W|D: the union of binding share-deny
 *     bits).  Held lazily (escalate-or-reuse): the hot I/O path never
 *     round-trips; only the first escalating acquire does.  The backend
 *     may grant a subset, and may later RECALL via the recall callback
 *     captured at acquire time; the node drains its local holders and
 *     releases (the release IS the recall ack).
 *
 *   RANGE: one binding, non-recallable record per byte-range lock, keyed by
 *     the cluster-stable owner identity (never a node id -- POSIX same-owner
 *     coalescing must survive a client landing on two nodes).  Confirmed
 *     before the local grant completes; all-or-nothing.  This is the wire a
 *     passthrough backend implements by taking a real lock on the file it
 *     is fronting, which is how cross-PROCESS conflicts (a host kernel, a
 *     remote NFS server) reach the arbitration the claim core is doing.
 *
 * The bits are separate because AGGREGATE rides the DATA path -- the core
 * re-evaluates the per-file union whenever local holders change, including
 * on first I/O -- while RANGE is only touched by byte-range locks.  A
 * passthrough backend wants ranges without paying a backend round trip per
 * file just to open one.
 *
 * A backend implements the same two ops (CHIMERA_VFS_OP_CLAIM_ACQUIRE /
 * _RELEASE) for whichever bits it sets, and invokes the recall callback --
